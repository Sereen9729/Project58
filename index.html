        <p class="para">My hobby is playing soccer in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to play soccer after completing my home work. I am 11 years old and play U13 soccer. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Soccer keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.
